for blocklist maintainers.

# Installation

You can install the tivilsta CLI or library through [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tivilsta).

```shell
$ cargo install tivilsta

$ tivilsta -V  ## Assuming that it is in your ${PATH}
```

# The Format

## Introduction

In a world where blocklists and whitelist lists are getting bigger and bigger,
the whitelisting mechanism we all use is still the same: list all whitelisted
domains and use some kind of shell magic to processed the whitelisting.

What if we want more ? That's what Tivilsta tries to provide: A better way of
writing whitelist list.

With Tivilsta you still have 1 domain per line but you also get some nice features
like for example regular expression _(regex)_. In fact, the Tivilsta project
has the same set of of "pure" rule that you know but also some flags like `ALL `,
`REG ` or `RDZ ` to fulfill many possible use cases that list maintainer may
need during the whitelisting process.

## The flags

Tivilsta provides a set of flags to make whitelist maintenance easier.

### No Flag: The purest rule

This is the purest of all rules. It is what we all know an cherish. The single
line without any flag.

```
example.org
```

In this example, any subject of your source file that literally matches `example.org`
will be whitelisted.

### `ALL `: The "ends-with" rule

Sometime when working with highly volatile dataset, you may want to whitelist
every subjects that ends with for example `gov.uk`.

With Tivilsta you can do that through the `ALL ` flag.

```
ALL .gov.uk
```

In this example, any subject of your source file that ends with `.gov.uk` -
`gov.uk` included - will be whitelisted.

### `REG `: The regular expression rule

You are a fan of regex ? We are too! When working with highly volatile dataset,
we want to simply use a regular expression (short regex) to do the task.

With Tivilsta you can do that through the `REG ` flag.

```
REG ^(?!.*\.?(watchdog\.ohio|dap\.digitalgov|stats\.ssa|adgallery\.whitehousedrugpolicy)).*\.gov$
```

In this example, any subject of your source file that ends with `.gov` will be
whitelisted except the following:

- `watchdog.ohio.gov`
- `dap.digitalgov.gov`
- `stats.ssa.gov`
- `adgallery.whiteshousedrugpolicy.gov`

### `RZD `: The broad and powerful rule

Have you ever wondered if it is possible to somehow whitelist all combination of
a company name with all possible Top Level Domain ?

With Tivilsta you can do that through the `RDZ ` flag. This flag is extremely
broad and powerful as it will fetch the
[IANA Root Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db) and the
[Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/)
to build a set of rules with all possible gTLDs or extensions - if you prefer.

```
RZD example
```

In this example, any subject matching `example.[gTLD]` will be whitelisted.


# Usage & Examples

## Library

```rust
use tivilsta::Ruler;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let my_subjects: Vec<String> = vec![
        String::from("example.com"),
        String::from("example.org"),
        String::from("api.example.org"),
        String::from("test.example.com"),
    ];

    let whitelisting_rules: Vec<String> = vec![
        String::from("api.example.org"),
        String::from("ALL .com"),
    ];

    let mut ruler = Ruler::new(false);
    ruler.parse_vec(&whitelisting_rules);

    for subject in my_subjects {
        if ruler.is_whitelisted(&subject) {
            println!("{} is WHITELISTED", subject)
        } else {
            println!("{} is still BLOCKLISTED", subject)
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

**Output:**

```
example.com is WHITELISTED
example.org is still BLOCKLISTED
api.example.org is WHITELISTED
test.example.com is WHITELISTED
```

## CLI

### Overview

Example for argument with multiple values or files:

- `tivilsta -s test.list -w whitelist1.list -w  whitelist2.list`
- `tivilsta -s test.list --reg reg1.list --reg reg2.list`


| Argument              | Required           | Multiple Values Allowed | Description                                                                                                                             |

| `--source` \| `-s`    | :white_check_mark: | :x:                     | The source file. In other word the block list to process.                                                                               |
| `--whitelist` \| `-w` | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:      | The whitelist schema file-s. Each line will be processed **AS IT IS.**                                                                  |
| `--all`               | :x:                | :white_check_mark:      | The whitelist schema file-s. Each line will be prefixed with the `ALL ` flag.                                                           |
| `--allow-complements` | :x:                | :x:                     | Whether we should consider complements when whitelisting. A complement is `www.example.org` when `example.org` is given and vice-versa. |

| `--reg`               | :x:                | :white_check_mark:      | The whitelist schema file-s. Each line will be prefixed with the `REG ` flag.                                                           |
| `--rzd`               | :x:                | :white_check_mark:      | The whitelist schema file-s. Each line will be prefixed with the `RDZ ` flag.                                                           |

    -V, --version                     Print version information
    -w, --whitelist <WHITELIST>...    One or multiple space separated whitelisting schema in form of

$ cat test.list
example.org
example.com
api.example.org
test.example.com
